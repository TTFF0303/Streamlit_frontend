## Technical Details

- **Frontend Framework**: Streamlit
- **Language**: Python 3.7+
- **Key Dependencies**: 
  - streamlit: Web framework
  - openai: AI API integration
  - pandas: Data processing
  - python-dotenv: Environment management
- **Logging**: Built-in Python logging module
- **Deployment**: Multiple options including Docker and Azure

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the app: `streamlit run main.py`
3. Access at: `http://localhost:8501`

## Customization

The application can be easily customized by:
1. Modifying the `MOCK_DATA` dictionary in `main.py`
2. Updating UI components in their respective render functions
3. Adding new session state variables for additional features
4. Extending the metrics definition interface for new data sources

This project provides a complete foundation for an AI-powered BI assistant that can be deployed to Azure Web App with minimal configuration.
